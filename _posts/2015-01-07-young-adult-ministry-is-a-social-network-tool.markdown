American Christianity feels increasingly alientated in today's culture. Their tool for reaching out to the culture's greatest consumers and greatest <i>victims</i>, as some of them fear, is to involve themselves in youth ministry. But as much as they often say they are <i>counter-cultural</i> and at odds with the world they operate at their core as a particular product of the Millenial Internet generation: the <i>social network</i>. As an at-times active member of youth ministry in the Midwest, I want to focus here on how youth and young adult ministry has adopted the style of a social network tool and, maybe unwittingly, are more effective because of it.

I grew up Catholic, and was very involved in 'youth ministry' throughout high school, which helped me surround myself with friends who shared similar values. However, I was tempted to believe it limited my network of ideas and I found it disturbingly narrow after high school. So throughout college, I began to lament my involvement in youth ministry, only to find that after college it was very difficult to meet young adults who shared the same values and knowledge of faith as I did. Inevitably, I went 'back' and <strong>I began attending a monthly 'Theology on Tap' session hosted by the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and I did so for three reasons</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Draft beer was served for $3, and since we were hosted at a craft brewery called Kirkwood Station it was a variety of all good beer.</li>
<li>There were a lot of very attractive girls there who I had never met and already we had enough in common to start talking.</li>
<li>I really did want to stay involved in my faith and keep up fresh discussion about it.</li>
</ol>
Each of these three things I found at Theology on Tap, and in great abundance I might add. As with any large group of new folks you quickly realize that not everyone there is exactly the same and everyone brings something different to the table; thus my fear that we were all being paid lip-service to conservative grumble or ephemeral church-speak was replaced with the excitement that I might find people who could become new and good friends. Most of all, the one friend who I now call my best friend and my girlfriend of 10 months.

So, I must admit, I have won in this little social world of a small part of the Millenial generation. Yet I grasp to find something more applicable that others can glean from such a group as well. I have found that <strong>young adult ministry is a clique social networking tool with a core set of values</strong>, meaning it fits the bill on what makes an organic, inviting, and growing competitor in our Internet-oriented society.

###Different from Facebook
Let's talk about what a <i>clique</i> social network is and how it is different from the champion of social networks: Facebook. Though a clique in itself is a negative conotation, here I think it is an appropriate adjective, because <strong>a clique social network is focused around narrower shared values and an organic outreach</strong>, which doesn't follow arbritrary relationships like 'friends' and 'family' but rather focuses on 'interests' and 'what in the world is the Eucharist?' in my Catholic example.

Clique social networks function from a need for fresh ideas yet sourced from a similar subculture or language. They are <i>social</i> because they reach out for new faces and minds instead of sticking to just aquaintances and old buddies. They are <i>networks</i> because they host events and arrange hangouts to grow personally and not on just the pillar of a few common truths. So they end up being a <i>clique</i> but only because they know who their target audience is, not strictly because they shut out others.

What is most powerful about <i>clique social networks</i> versus Facebook or LinkedIn is that the relationships they forge are easily <i>branded, identified, and communicable</i>, spurring on organic growth and full potentials to be met. Facebook hides under ambiguous and individualistic 'liking' while clique social networks operate under their own upvoting system. Members contribute content which 

My experience with the Catholic Young Adult ministry has been so positive because I stepped outside of my circle of close friends (who are still my close friends) in order to fill a void of specific values, namely others who are interested in talking and practicing the same faith with me. But such a thing happens within other communities today, like those who share an interest in Drupal or Javascript, board games or volunteer efforts. <strong>Here are some of the things I think make up a <i>clique social network</i></strong>:
<ul>
<li>Regular meetups and casual get-togethers open to anyone interested, but with a general audience in mind</li>
<li>A few core values are the identifiable brand and trade of the group</li>
<li>Content comes from within the group, not consumed from outside</li>
<li>Members share their unique expressions of their values, free to enhance and shape their peers</li>
</ul>
It sounds weird that 'being open to anyone' and 'sharing unique expressions' are applied to a 'clique' (and what's more, a faith-oriented one). Yet I think that's the phenomenon of it, for such organic, small, focused social networks exist for a number of things, if not for as core or personal values. The point is: <strong>clique social networks are the key to bringing strangers together who wouldn't otherwise know how to meet</strong>, and whether the Archdiocese of St. Louis knows this or not, their Young Adult Ministry program is just that. This is a good thing, even if it sounds like it is straight out of the culture so often at odds with, because it is <i>organic, member-oriented,</i> and <i>easily identifiable</i>. These are the values Young Adult Ministry should always strive for, never fearing that they could ever compromise their mission to enliven the faith of young adults.
