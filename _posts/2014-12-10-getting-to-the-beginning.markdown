title: Getting to the Beginning

I am terrible at two things: interesting others in a favorite book or movie of mine, and tip-toeing into something new. As with all beginnings, the end <strike>seems</strike> <i>is</i> so far away. My present end is to begin this blog, but my end is to achieve a goal I cannot even properly say. Thus, instead of carefully planning out my path and assessing my means, I do what I always do with something new: I recklessly dive right in. 

Have you ever been in a similar situation? It is like you are standing amongst peers--at least some of whom you wish to impress--and the punchline of a good joke occurs to you that guarantees a revolutionary turn of attention upon yourself. The line, already impressing yourself by its cleverness and originality, rushes past the mechanics between your mouth and brain that you have begun to interrupt the flow of conversation and prepare your would-be audience before your performers have even practiced their lines. Then comes a moment when you laughingly realize you will not be able to deliver a product on time, and so you throw yourself headlong against the wave of avoidable inevitability:
<blockquote>YOU: Ah! That reminds me of something you all would enjoy!<br />
SINGLETON 1: Oh yeah, what then?<br />
YOU: No, no...I can't remember it, it goes something like...gosh it was just on the tip of my tonge, you would have liked it very much. It was like from a play but I can't remember it...<br />
SINGLETON 2: Did it have to do with our department's move to IT Governance Office?<br />
YOU: No, it was...the way you just told J-- about the QuikTrip pizza made me think of something else entirely, I just. Oh! It was like...<br />
SINGLETON 1: Uh huh? (<i>He is a fellow who knows you better than the others present</i>)<br />
YOU: It had to do with something I read in my college class, one I took almost five years ago. Gosh it was so funny...I'm sorry, it was just funnier in my head.</blockquote>
I mark such instances with the characteristic <i>desire</i> to share something with someone else. It is a desire to share something that might reveal a truth or new perspective to the other, yet too a desire which is overwhelmingly <i>passionate</i>. You are excited. Elated. Flushed and joyous. As if you just figured out some piece of logic in difficult code. You are able to laugh at yourself and at the same time laugh at those who are not at once converted by your passion, for it seems to you that the <i>passion enough changes the mind</i>.

Or so I have found it. After all, I'm not very good at explaining things, and not very good at plotting my course.

Here I begin my blog, then. It is an adventure in just this sort of feeling: I have a desire and am compelled to do something with it. My desire is that I might reveal some sort of small nuggets to you: a few ideas I've had or others' I've stumbled upon. You have little time and you could care less what I think, so my task is very difficult--yes, BUT: If I might reveal myself to you, and make tangible all my real and passionate desire to share with you, we both might both embark on a great and noble enterprise.
