Let's get something straight: there's nothing particular about writing daily that makes it so difficult to pick up and start doing. But what I have found is that writing is a purely <i>creative</i> unlike other habits we could work on forming daily.

Take running, for instance. I never ran much as a teenager and loathed the thought of running ridiculous distances. Then one day while we were both a little under the 'buzz juice' my roommate suggests we do a marathon, and we both sign up there on the spot. He showed me a workout schedule, chose a routine that was easy for me, and helped me believe I could do the marathon <strong><i>as long as I followed the schedule</i></strong>. Sure enough, I trained through the hardest winter the MidWest has had in over 20 years, all by myself, and finished my first marathon within 4.5hrs.

Similarly, I have picked up piano again after so many years. For about 12 years I played piano and became proficient but not excellent. I stopped right before my senior year of high school and was able to teach myself again by using the tried-and-true Hanon's <i>Virtuoso Pianist</i> which promises in its own words:  <i>"<strong>If this be repeated daily for a time,</strong> difficulties will disappear as if by enchantment, and that beautiful, clear, clenan, pearling execution will have been acquired."</i>

As any habit-forming excercise goes, these really do require nothing more than daily attentiveness, for an hour at best, in order to really master them. Yet running and piano-playing all have a certain similar characteristic to them which makes them easier to begin doing daily than writing does: <i>follow the rule book and you'll do fine</i>. There aren't much guidelines for how to write, especially since writing well is purely subjective and has to be discovered from within.

Therefore, how to begin writing daily if it's so hard to come up with materials on what to write about? Or how to write? Indeed, let me be the first to say my writing is terrible, but especailly when I haven't edited it yet!

Then I happened to find a very helpful article on Medium called "[How to Develop A Daily Writing Habit](https://medium.com/@mattangriffel/how-to-develop-a-daily-writing-habit-475732c2b026)" which I hope you now turn to and read since, after all, it's the article which got me started writing anyway. But his point is important: <strong><i>you have to set some metrics for yourself</i></strong>. Make them attainable goals, but concrete and numerical, almost brooding goals. 

Mattan, the author of the article, uses a clear 750 word count as his indicator that he's written enough for the day, claiming that it is 1-page single-spaced typed, or 3 pages written. That's a lot of writing, considering it's intended to be done simply as a daily practice to prepare for more meaningful writing when time or length is not of consequence. But Mattan claims that he can write 750 words within a 10-15minute span now that he has become so dedicated to his habit. I am currently at 500 words and have spent 20 minutes doing this. Then again, I did get up to find my Hanon piano book, fill up my glass of water, search Medium in order to find Mattan's article, and do a little editing of this post as I write, so maybe there is hope.

The key to writing daily is to not edit until you've finally written to your goal or satisfaction, because the point of writing daily is to <i>just do it</i>. No need to find the right header image or to reword your sentences just yet, you will have another hour or so later if you want it published. For now, it's all about forming the habit, and so 750 words in a 10-15 minute span is not just doable but necessary for flexing the thoughts stored in your head.

I espeically believe in the creative processes requiring new ideas or writings a chance to be presented well before they have been polished and refined. Although it is not wise to publish your 'latest hasty thoughts' as soon as you're finished writing them, simply writing them is itself a form of presentation which exposes your true potential hidden beneath bad grammar and poor logic. The good teacher sees the potential in his students well before they've reached any sort of maturity, so he takes them as they are, so long as they are willing to work.

For a daily habit of writing to be formed, you must be willing to work towards your word-count goal. Along the way, you will discover that nugget of an awesome idea you thought of long before.
