<div style="text-align: center;"><i>If you had told me three years ago where I'd be today I wouldn't believe it</i></div>
<br />What can I say but that I have gone through some dramatic change in my life over the past three years? A vast understatement, but I am not here to prove by how much it is. And by <i>here</i> I mean my cozy little apartment in St. Louis' Central West End neighborhood, just two blocks south of the Cathedral Bascilica and three blocks east of Forest Park. It is not just affordable and nice, it is in the middle of the most happening part of my burgeoning city. On the other side of the park, just one block south of the zoo, lives my girlfriend in a little apartment of her own. We have been dating for almost a year and have adventured almost every one of the city's treasures together.

I have the perfect job as a web developer at one of Fortune Magazine's top 100 best places to work. My team just built a full-featured app for the entire IT department and have gained considerable demand to expand the availability to the rest of the company and even to our customers. As an independent contractor on the side I have built two new websites for two local Catholic parishes and redone another for my aunt.

Could you have told me that I would run a marathon? Or that I would have trained for that marathon during the worst winter in the past 30 years? Or that I would have run by myself? For no other reason than to just do it? You probably could have told me but I probably would have told you to bug off.

<h3>Three years ago...</h3>

Three years ago I was still a seminarian at Catholic Kenrick-Glennon seminary, just finishing up my first year of graduate school and spending the summer at Creighton University in Omaha. Along with hundreds of other seminarians from across the world I was enrolled in a summer semester of priestly formation with a very new and somewhat odd theological language that framed it. My peers and I expressed frustration and confusion throughout several classes, breakouts, and conferences. Most of our frustration came from observing the relative ease with which some seminarians passively and obediently accepted the teachings and presumptions of the program, while objections and dissent my peers and I voiced went dismissed or marked disruptive.

The coursework was not academic and worse placating. Classes on a young man's sexual identity in the light of the Church's ongoing scandals challenged me to question whether they had adequately met the problem of insufficent human formation in the seminary. Whereas Kenrick-Glennon and some of my closest teachers/priests prioritized a holistic, human formation for men over the necessary but secondary spiritual formation, at least to recognize it as an equal pillar in the formation of the priest, this Institute of Priestly Formation&mdash;in its name claiming authority on the formation process&mdash;went so far to elevate spiritual formation as to dismiss or conflate the other three pillars.

The summer semester lasted 10 weeks long and it was to be the most fruitful period of writing for me in my life thus far. Though my objections were not received well or answered, I found the stirrings of my individual consciousness expressed on the pages of my journal.
