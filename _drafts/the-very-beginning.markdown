title: The Very Beginning
---

I want to start writing and never stop writing. What I have seen and heard over these years about the people of Lithuania should not be lost with my old age and impending death. There is much to say, I fear I might miss the most important points. Therefore I shall start with the most important story of them all: to settle the account of the Iron Wolf: how he was the true successor to Lithuania's rule, how he ousted the usurper and traitor Daumantas, how he fought bravely against the Teutonic Knights in open combat and cunning deeds, how he saved his our beloved Daina from assassination at the hands of the brutal Traidenis, how he brought the holy faith to the people of the land, and how he gloriously died of old age just two weeks hence. Here it shall be written, by the hand of my best scribe, Daudemundus, whose accounts of the Brothers of the Sword are well known.
Let me then be no more than the Auctor, without a name or some vestige y which you might recognize me, for I have no such feature. I am the unrecognizable witness to all these acts, silently watching the sake of the coming world, that the glory of God might be revealed. I have patiently studied from the very beginning and contemplated what sort of meaning the Lord might have in store for these events. But season after season, and now year and year, the irreversible force of grace fought stupendously with the wickedness of man.
We begin with an incantation and blessing:
O Holy and All-Powerful Father, who from of old led your people Israel to glory, and punished those who disobeyed your command, cleanse from this land the scourge of the crusader knights, that living in peace your people may know joy and sing out the praise of your Holy Name throughout the land, we ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen
