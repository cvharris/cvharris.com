title: The 'Both-And' Theory

There is a very basic Thomistic principle which is not explicitly stated anywhere in St. Thomas Aquinas' writings but which is nonetheless relied upon over and over again as he writes his lengthy answers to disputed philosophical and theological questions of his time, and I call it the 'Both-And' principle.

This Both-And principle is when a seemingly dialectic 'either-or' choice is left as an ultimatum and absolutely <i>finishing</i> decision to be made. Simply put, "Why leave yourself with only two irreconcilable choices? Why not a third choice which brings the two together in a new way?" 

It is not a principle of compromise, necessarily, because the theird option in a 'Both-And' decision is a a holistic option as opposed to the dualistic 'either-or' choices. That is why 'Either-Or' is not a principle opposed to Both-And or a principle <i>per se</i> (although I still don't exactly know what Soren Kierkegaard had to say about it).

Let's give some more examples. First, St. Thomas' own use of this principle is best highlighted when his contemporaries fought annoyingly over whether the human person was comprised of just a material body or just an immaterial soul. It is one of the perrenial questions of philsophy and not an easy one to argue but St. Thomas' approach was simple: the human person was both body <i>and</i> soul in a third, holistic entity existing on its own whereas neither the body nor the soul constituted the human person in its entirety.

What about the plight of the unappreciated artist? Should you follow your dreams as a writer or just settle for a boring but well-paying job? Well, why not both? Find a lifestyle that supports your passion.

<br />Now I used to think the 'Both-And' approach was only a philosophical tool and was useful only when clearing the air on emotional topics. Yet more often than not I found this an applicable 'trick', if you will, in any number of meetings, grooming sessions, or conversations discussing our work.
